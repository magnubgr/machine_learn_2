QUESTIONS:
Referere til Scikit-Plot/Scikit-Learn


Over the weekend:

merge neural net to one file
look at why test and train are incorrect
run_user interface perhaps?
comments on code
Double check that the test functions are working
perhaps more illustrations in theory?
Do we need to plot a loss function for the logistic regression?

Michael: update run_all.sh

Remember clear commit messages over the weekend
