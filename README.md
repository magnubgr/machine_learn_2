# Project for Machine learning for Michael Bitney and Magnus Grøndalen
This is a machine learning project where process credit card data and use machine learning to extrapolate patterns and other data.

Here we have built two classes, one called Regression_package and one called NeuralNet_package.
The Regression_package contains Linear Regression which has 3 methods (OLS,Ridge,Lasso) and LogisticRegressor which performs a gradient descent.
The NeuralNet_package contains a Logistic NeuralNet and regression NeuralNet.
